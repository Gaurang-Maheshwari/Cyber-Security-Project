# Cybersecurity Attack Detection and Response Simulation

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a simulation of automated cybersecurity threat detection and response. The model classifies network traffic into different categories of attacks and triggers appropriate automated responses for detected threats.

## Features
- Detects various network attacks (e.g., DDoS, port scanning, unauthorized access).
- Simulates automated responses such as blocking IPs or alerting the security team based on the attack type.
- Includes an example simulation for testing predictions on network traffic data.

## Technologies Used
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For writing and running Python code.
- **Python**: The programming language used.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model development (assumed).
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis (assumed).
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations (assumed).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed.
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `numpy`

You can install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
